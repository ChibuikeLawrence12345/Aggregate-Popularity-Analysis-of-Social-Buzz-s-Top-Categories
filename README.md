# Aggregate Popularity Analysis of Social Buzz's Top Categories
##  Introduction  
This project looks at engagement trends for **Social Buzz**, a fast-growing social media and content company.  
The goal was to identify **which content categories are most popular with users** and how the company can use these insights to **increase engagement and unlock revenue opportunities**.

##  Problem Statement  
Social Buzz generates over **100,000 posts every day** â€“ more than **36 million pieces of content per year**.

2. **Reactions** â€“ *25,554 rows, 5 columns*  
   - Fields: Content ID, User ID, Type, Datetime  
   - Captures how users reacted to posts.  

3. **Reaction Types** â€“ *17 rows, 4 columns*
